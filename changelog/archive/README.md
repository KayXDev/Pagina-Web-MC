# Changelog Archive

This folder stores older changelog entries so the root `CHANGELOG.md` stays short and readable.

## Convention

- Keep `CHANGELOG.md` focused on the most recent entries.
- When the root changelog starts getting long, move older dated entries into year files here:
  - `changelog/archive/2026.md`
  - `changelog/archive/2027.md`
- Preserve the original ISO timestamps and headings when moving entries.
