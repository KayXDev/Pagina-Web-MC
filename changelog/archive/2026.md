> *Stability + operations update (Vercel + background jobs) + docs polish.*

### ✨ Added

- 🧾 **Security Policy**: vulnerability reporting flow in [SECURITY.md](../../SECURITY.md).
- 📝 **Changelog**: project change tracking in [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md).
- 🕒 **Daily cron aggregator** (`/api/cron/daily`) to run multiple scheduled tasks under Vercel plan limitations.

### 🔧 Changed

- ⏱️ **Cron scheduling** consolidated to a **single daily** cron in Vercel config.
- 🔐 **Cron authorization** accepts Vercel Cron (`user-agent: vercel-cron/1.0`) and still supports manual triggering via secret.

### 🐛 Fixed

- 🧠 **Mongoose warning**: replaced deprecated `{ new: true }` with `returnDocument: 'after'` for update operations.
- 🌐 **Cron runtime consistency**: ensured cron routes run on the Node.js runtime.
- 🛰️ **Minecraft status check**: removed Axios usage for the status call to reduce Node deprecation warnings and keep timeouts from producing noisy logs.

### 📌 Notes

- 📰 The app includes **News/Blog**, **Forum**, **Profiles**, **Store**, **Tickets/Support**, **Notifications**, and a full **Admin panel** (see [README.md](../../README.md)).
